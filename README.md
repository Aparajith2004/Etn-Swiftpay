Inspiration
Cryptocurrencies are growing in popularity, yet real-world adoption for everyday transactions remains limited. Many businesses and consumers hesitate due to complex processes, slow transactions, and the volatility of crypto prices. Inspired by the need for a seamless and scalable crypto payment solution, ETN Swift-Pay was created to make Electroneum (ETN) payments as easy as using a credit cardâ€”fast, secure, and user-friendly.

ETN Swift-Pay is a mobile-based crypto payment gateway that allows users to:
Make instant ETN transactions via QR code scanning.
Enable merchants to accept ETN payments with automatic fiat conversion.
Ensure security and transparency through blockchain verification.
Offer a user-friendly interface for both businesses and consumers.
Provide transaction tracking & history within the app.
